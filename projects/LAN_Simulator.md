A local area network, or LAN, is a computer network that interconnects computers within an area such as a residence or school. In this EE 367 project, our team was given the code for a simple local area network with basic capabilities such as being able to ping another host and uploading a file to another host. The team was tasked to implement several improvements to the network, which were adding a switch node to the network as well as a simple domain name service (DNS) server.
