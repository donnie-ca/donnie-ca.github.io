## My journey thus far

Since I was a kid, I've always been a little bit of a tech nerd. My knowledge was very limited of course, but I was always the kid to go to whenever any of my classmates had a simple computer problem. Despite this, I've never actually taken any programming or computer related classes in high school, and I was unsure of what I wanted to do as a career. My interest in majoring in computer engineering piqued after I graduated high school, when I spontaneously decided to learn python on my own. I was drawn in by the complexity and endless possibilities of things that are possible to create with the knowledge of programming, and I was fascinated by how the applications we use on a daily basis are built by words and numbers on a screen, and on an even lower level, by 1s and 0s. As of this moment, I am now in my fourth year of university with about a year left until graduation, and I am glad I took this route for my career.

## My experience with the class's style of learning 

When it comes to the WODs, I find them to be beneficial but also stressful. Even though the problems themselves are pretty easy, the timed nature of the WODs adds a layer of stress and pressure, especially since there is a possibility that I might not finish in time and get a DNF. What if I dont immediately know how to solve the problem? What if I get several bugs I'm not able to locate and I take too long? These are some of the questions I tend to think about just before and during the WODs. Despite this stress, the WODs are actually proving to be a very useful tool in helping me practice and familiarize myself with TypeScript. Working under pressure is also not necessarily a bad thing, as many technical interviews will require me to write code properly and efficiently within a certain time. Overall, I enjoy the style of learning the WODs provide because it pushes me to adapt and think critically under pressure
