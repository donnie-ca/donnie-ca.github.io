## My experience with TypeScript so far

As a complete newbie to TypeScript, my initial experience with the language was slightly confusing, mainly due to its syntax. As a computer engineering major, I probably don't do as much programming as my computer science peers, and in turn haven't been exposed to as many languages. Having primarily worked with C and C++ for the majority of my college courses so far, learning JavaScript and TypeScript felt a bit challenging at first. When I was learning the basics of JavaScript, the concept of using "var" and "let" instead of declaring the data type definitely felt odd. Then came along TypeScript, where I was required to declare the types of the variable, but in a syntax I wasn't used to. During the first practice WODs, I found myself having to look online or ask my classmates for help on how to get the proper syntax. However, as I continue to learn, I am starting to feel more comfortable with TypeScript. The languages type-safety features have gradually begun to make more sense and it has become more enjoyable to learn.

## My experience with the class's style of learning 

When it comes to the WODs, I find them to be beneficial but also stressful. Even though the problems themselves are pretty easy, the timed nature of the WODs adds a layer of stress and pressure, especially since there is a possibility that I might not finish in time and get a DNF. What if I dont immediately know how to solve the problem? What if I get several bugs I'm not able to locate and I take too long? These are some of the questions I tend to think about just before and during the WODs. Despite this stress, the WODs are actually proving to be a very useful tool in helping me practice and familiarize myself with TypeScript. Working under pressure is also not necessarily a bad thing, as many technical interviews will require me to write code properly and efficiently within a certain time. Overall, I enjoy the style of learning the WODs provide because it pushes me to adapt and think critically under pressure
