Wordle is an online game that has you guessing a random word in 6 tries. I've decided to create a discord bot that so I could add it into a server and play the same game in discord. This can make the game more interesting and interactive because your friends may be watching you live while you fail to guess your word. This project was done using node.js, an open-source JavaScript runtime environment. To initialize the bot, discord.js (a node.js module used to interact with the discord API) was used. 

This project proved to be a valuable learning experience for many reasons. First, it was a project that started from scratch and was completed as a fully functioning product that others can use. I believe this type of experience is crucial for students because it better emulates the role of a software developer compared to many of the small projects we do in class strictly for learning purposes. Second, this project required me to use different technologies such as node.js and the discord API. Using these new technologies helps to expand my arsenal of skills, which furthur helps me in my developing career.
